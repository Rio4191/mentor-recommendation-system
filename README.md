Mentor Recommendation System

This project is a recommendation model designed for CLAT (Common Law Admission Test) aspirants. It utilizes randomly generated data for both mentors and aspirants to provide tailored mentorship recommendations.

Overview

The system aims to connect CLAT aspirants with suitable mentors based on various criteria. By analyzing the profiles of both mentors and aspirants, the model suggests optimal mentorship pairings to enhance the preparation process.

Features

Random Data Generation: Creates synthetic datasets for mentors and aspirants to simulate real-world scenarios.​
Recommendation Algorithm: Implements a matching mechanism to pair aspirants with appropriate mentors.​
